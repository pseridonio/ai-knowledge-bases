# AI Knowledge Bases

This will be my personal repository for knowledge bases about software development topics, including design patterns, best practices, and architectural principles. Each knowledge base will provide an in-depth overview of a specific topic, including its intent, problems it solves, key participants, structure, and when to use it.

I will use this knowledge bases to create knowledgeable AI assistants that can help me with software development tasks, such as code generation, code review, and design advice. The AI assistants will be trained on the knowledge bases and will be able to provide accurate and relevant information about the topics covered in the knowledge bases.
